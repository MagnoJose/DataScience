Training a Hospital Turnover Model: The Importance of Prediction
Creating a notebook to train a model for predicting hospital turnover is a strategic initiative crucial for efficiently managing human resources in hospitals. High turnover rates among healthcare professionals pose significant challenges, increasing operational costs and compromising the continuity and quality of patient care. The goal of this project is to understand and predict turnover, enabling the implementation of strategies that mitigate its negative impacts.

Understanding the Problem
Employee turnover in hospitals not only elevates costs related to recruitment and training but also affects staff morale and the quality of care. The loss of experienced professionals creates a learning curve for new hires, potentially diminishing the quality of care provided. For hospital managers, predicting turnover is crucial for implementing actions to reduce this phenomenon.

Exploring the Data
We began the project with an exploratory data analysis. We loaded a dataset containing detailed information about hospital employees, such as age, gender, role, tenure, and turnover history. From this analysis, we identified patterns and factors influencing employees' decisions to leave the organization.

Data Preparation
The data preparation stage involved transforming categorical variables, handling missing values, and eliminating duplicates. Ensuring the data was clean and ready for predictive modeling was essential. We also conducted a descriptive analysis to better understand the dataset's characteristics.

Predictive Analysis
We used advanced machine learning techniques to build a predictive turnover model. The goal was to identify which employees are at the highest risk of leaving the hospital. Tools like ProfileReport were used to generate detailed data profiles, helping to identify key variables.

Benefits of Turnover Prediction
Cost Reduction: Predicting turnover helps reduce operational costs associated with employee turnover, such as recruitment and training.

Improved Quality of Care: Maintaining a stable and experienced team enhances the continuity and quality of patient care.

Strategic Planning: Enables more effective human resource planning, including the creation of retention and professional development programs.

Data-Driven Decision Making: Decisions based on concrete data are more accurate and reliable, allowing for more targeted and effective actions.

Competitiveness and Innovation: Adopting advanced technologies positions the hospital as an innovative institution, attracting talent that values modernity and efficiency.

In summary, developing this notebook not only helps predict employee turnover but also empowers hospital managers to make informed and strategic decisions. Predictive analysis transforms data into valuable insights, contributing to a more stable and satisfying work environment and ensuring high-quality patient care.
